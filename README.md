I just want to write an Android Music Player which can meet my demand.

After I have tried many Music Player on Google Play, I found none of them
can meet my demand.
1. Poweramp cannot play lyric.
2. Baidu Music cannot play local lyric, the ad is also noisy.
3. MusicMax though can play local lyric, it cannot recognize the encode.
Initially I want to add the function, but I found that it was not open-source.
4. Nearly all of them use artwork provided by Android MediaStore API, while
I have some DIY albums that were made up of songs from different albums.

What I want to make is
1. A music player that can play local lyric.
2. Auto-recognize the encode of lyric file.
3. Use song artword instead of album.

Additional functions:
1. Visualizations.
2. Rhythm game.
3. Fetch lyric from websites and save locally.
4. Low battery usage, bug-free(please ignore it >.<)
