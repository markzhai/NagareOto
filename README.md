I just want to write an Android Music Player which can meet my demand.

Description
----
After I have tried many Music Player on Google Play, I found none of them
can meet my demand.
### Existing Music Players
* Poweramp cannot play lyric.
* Baidu Music cannot play local lyric, the ad is also noisy.
* MusicMax though can play local lyric, it cannot recognize the encode.
Initially I want to add the function, but I found that it was not open-source.
*  Nearly all of them use artwork provided by Android MediaStore API, while
I have some DIY albums that were made up of songs from different albums.

Plan
----
### What I want to make is
* A music player that can play local lyric.
* Auto-recognize the encode of lyric file.
* Use song artword instead of album.

### Additional functions:
* Visualizations.
* Rhythm game.
* Fetch lyric from websites and save locally.
* Low battery usage, bug-free(please ignore it >.<)
